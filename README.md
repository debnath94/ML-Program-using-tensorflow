Problem statement :
The following dataset consists of 1030 instances with 9 attributes and has no missing values. There are 8 input variables and 1 output variable. Seven input variables represent the amount of raw material (measured in kg/mÂ³) and one represents Age (in Days). The target variable is Concrete Compressive Strength measured in (Mega Pascal). Build a Neural network model to predict the compressive strength.
